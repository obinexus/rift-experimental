=== AEGIS Branch Divergence Resolution & Build Enhancement ===
Project: OBINexus RIFT Ecosystem
Methodology: AEGIS Waterfall with Zero Trust Enforcement

Starting AEGIS comprehensive build system enhancement...
Phase 1: Git Branch Divergence Resolution
----------------------------------------
Configuring merge strategy: merge (preserve commit history)
Executing systematic pull with merge resolution...
✓ Branch divergence resolved successfully
✓ Git divergence resolved - proceeding with build enhancement

Phase 2: Comprehensive Build System Enhancement
----------------------------------------------
Generating Hash Table Build System for O(1) Feature Lookup...
✓ Hash table build system generated with O(1) feature lookup
Generating Sinphase Integration with Zero Trust Enforcement...
✓ Sinphase zero trust integration generated
Generating riftdocs Build System Integration...
✓ riftdocs build system integration generated
Generating comprehensive Makefile coordination...
✓ Comprehensive Makefile coordination generated
Generating advanced CMakeLists.txt integration...
✓ Advanced CMakeLists.txt integration generated
Generating comprehensive pkg-config system...
✓ Comprehensive pkg-config system generated

=== AEGIS Comprehensive Build System Enhancement Complete ===
Components Generated:
- Hash table build system with O(1) feature lookup
- Sinphase integration with zero trust enforcement
- riftdocs build system integration
- Comprehensive Makefile coordination
- Advanced CMakeLists.txt integration
- Complete pkg-config system

Next Steps:
1. Execute: make -f Makefile.comprehensive all
2. Or use: cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
3. Test: make -f Makefile.comprehensive test
4. Generate docs: make -f Makefile.comprehensive docs
